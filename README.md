# Gibbs Sampling for the Uninitiated with Python
This repo is inspired by the _masterpiece_ of [**Gibbs Sampling tutorial**](https://maranathaedu-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/hendra_bunyamin_it_maranatha_edu/EZA9beLgBdZPip9br-UrdSAB024P8IBGESYAbJP3MfRQFQ?e=HdMzZ9) by _Resnik and Hardisty_ and also an _awesome_ [**github repo**](https://github.com/bobflagg/gibbs-sampling-for-the-uninitiated) by _Bob Flagg_.     

Personally, I would like to thank _Philip Resnik_ and _Eric Hardisty_ for providing such valuable learning materials. Last but not least, I also thank _Bob Flagg_ for giving such excellent implementations.     
May GOD bless You All!
